# Apple Podcasts Transcript Extractor

This script extracts transcripts from the Podcasts app on macOS.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

Note: You need to download the desired podcast episode before you can extract the transcript.

### Batch Mode
To process all TTML files in your Apple Podcasts cache:
```bash
node extractTranscript.js [--timestamps]
```

This will:
1. Find all TTML files in `~/Library/Group Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts/Library/Cache/Assets/TTML`
2. Create a `./transcripts` directory
3. Save each transcript as `./transcripts/<short_episode_id>.txt`

### Timestamps Option
Add `--timestamps` to include timestamps for each paragraph in the format `[HH:MM:SS]`.

For example:
```
[00:01:23] This is what the speaker said
[00:01:25] And then they said this
```

### Single File Mode
```bash
node extractTranscript.js <input_file> <output_file> [--timestamps]
```

## Where does the input file come from?

The input file comes from the `transcript_<long_episode_id>.ttml` file in the `Library/Cache/Assets/TTML/PodcastContent<short_episode_id>` directory.

## How do I get the episode IDs?

I don't know how these IDs are generated by the Podcasts app.
